Summary
The Bank Management System (BMS) is designed to efficiently manage core banking operations, including customer account management, transactions, loan processing, employee records, and the management of customer nominee information. The system ensures secure and accurate handling of data through relational database concepts such as foreign key constraints, primary key identification, and transaction logging. It integrates real-world banking scenarios, facilitating the tracking of accounts, processing of transactions (both credit and debit), loan management, and detailed records of employee activities.

Additionally, the system includes a Customer Nominee Management feature that enables banks to store and manage nominees associated with customer accounts. This is crucial in cases of emergency, inheritance, or other legal matters.

A Customer Log feature has been introduced to track any changes made to the customer records, ensuring that all modifications are captured for auditing and compliance purposes. This log helps the bank maintain a comprehensive history of customer-related changes, which is vital for traceability, security, and regulatory requirements.

Scenario
In a banking environment, multiple branches serve a variety of customers with different account types and loan products. Each branch operates with designated employees who assist customers in managing their accounts, applying for loans, and conducting transactions. The Bank Management System (BMS) allows for efficient tracking of account balances, processing of transactions (debit and credit), and management of customer loans.

Furthermore, the Customer Nominee Management system allows the bank to store and track nominees for each customer, ensuring that in the event of unforeseen circumstances, the correct individuals can be identified to handle the customer's financial matters.

To support this, the system logs all operations related to customer records, ensuring a traceable history of changes made to any customer-related data.
